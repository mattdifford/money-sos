      As long as you can prove your identity and provide an address, any legal UK resident over the age of 18 can open a current account, and some banks will accept applicants aged 16 and over. If your chosen account comes with an automatic overdraft facility, you might need to undergo a credit check.

    question: Can I open a current account?
  - answer: >-
      Your current account is where your money will ‘live’, so think about how you’ll want to use it. How much will be coming in and going out each month? Will you need an overdraft from time to time? Will you be moving your money regularly? They’re all key considerations to bear in mind.

    question: What should I think about when choosing a current account?

      - __Standard current account -__ the ‘typical’ answer. Accompanied by a debit card, this type of account allows you to have your salary paid directly to you, manage payments (direct debits, standing orders, etc.) and can offer overdraft options.

      - __Packaged current account -__ for people who want additional extras. For a monthly or annual fee, that might include breakdown cover, travel insurance and cashback rewards, among others.

      - __Basic bank account -__ for people who have recently moved to the UK or those with poor credit. Offer ‘no frills’ banking services.

      - __Student account -__ designed specifically for college or university students. An interest-free overdraft is often a standard feature.

      - __Graduate account -__ usually offering interest-free overdrafts for three years. Designed to help clear any  overdrafts accumulated during university years.

    question: What different accounts are available?
  - answer: >-
      
      Unless you’ve chosen a packaged account that carries an agreed fee (either monthly or annually), there’s typically no charge for having a current account.

      
      Withdrawing money from cash machines, and making contactless, over-the-counter or online purchases are also usually free.

      
      Charges can arise if you use privately owned or overseas cash machines, though. 

      
      In terms of overdrafts, you may have to pay for the facility with your current account, and you’ll certainly be charged if you go into an overdraft that hasn’t be prearranged.
