    ### About equity release

    Equity release is a way of releasing cash from your home while you still live in it. 
    
    
    You can take a lump sum all at once, a series of lump sums when it suits you or a regular income, allowing you get the money you need to enjoy your later years. You donâ€™t have to repay anything back until you die or move out of your home into long-term care.
