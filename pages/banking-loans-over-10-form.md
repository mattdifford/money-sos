    ### What to look for in your loan


    When you’re taking out a loan of over £10,000, you need to be sure of a few things. Is the APR/interest rate affordable and competitive? Is the term suitable for you – and are you able to repay early if possible? Is any security required?


    Use moneySOS, and you’ll be matched to a lender who can help you work through each of these questions, and arrive at an answer that’s suited to you.
