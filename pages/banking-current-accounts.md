    ### About current accounts


    A current account is a bank or building society account that allows you to manage your spending on a day-to-day basis. Your salary can be paid into it, and direct debits and standing orders can be set up. Some current accounts pay interest on balances, offer cashback on spending and many come with an overdraft facility.
