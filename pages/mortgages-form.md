    ### Choosing your mortgage


    Whether it’s to buy your home, move into buying-to-let or refinancing an existing house, a mortgage is often the biggest financial commitment many of us will make.

    And that’s what moneySOS is all about. We’ll help you see through the complexity of the mortgage market, connecting you directly to the most suitable partner for you.

    ### Why use moneySOS?

    
    Unlike the many online comparison tools available, moneySOS uses artificial intelligence to understand exactly what you’re looking for and then find your most likely money match. 

    
    So you won’t be presented with long lists of possibles, potentials and probables. Instead, our technology does all of that work for you instantly, connecting you directly to what suits you best, right away.

    
    Each of the moneySOS tools is free to use and guides you through the process in quick, easy steps. By answering a few simple questions, you’re matched with a specific supplier, product or service, based on cost, customer reviews or location.

    
    **And that’s all there is to it. Money matched to you in a matter of minutes.**
