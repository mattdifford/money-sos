    ### Why use moneySOS?

    
    Unlike the many online comparison tools available, moneySOS uses artificial intelligence to understand exactly what you’re looking for and then find your most likely money match. 

    
    So you won’t be presented with long lists of possibles, potentials and probables. Instead, our technology does all of that work for you instantly, connecting you directly to what suits you best, right away.

    
    Each of the moneySOS tools is free to use and guides you through the process in quick, easy steps. By answering a few simple questions, you’re matched with a specific supplier, product or service, based on cost, customer reviews or location.

    
    **And that’s all there is to it. Money matched to you in a matter of minutes.**
