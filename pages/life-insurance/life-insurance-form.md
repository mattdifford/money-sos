    ### Why should I get life insurance?

    Life insurance is a policy that pays out a lump sum to your loved ones if you pass away during the time youâ€™re covered.
    
    People generally avoid talking about death. It's the one subject that makes us all a bit uneasy, but the truth is that every year in the UK 45,000 children lose a parent.

    If the worst happens to you, life insurance pays out a lump sum, which your family can then use to pay off a mortgage, replace an income or allow your family to maintain their current standard of living.

    You can choose the amount you would want to be paid out if the worst were to happen, and your monthly payments will depend on your medical history and circumstances, giving you control of your policy.
