    ### What to look for in your loan


    When choosing a loan under £10,000, the first thing most people check for is the interest rate or APR. And that’s obviously a critical factor in your choice of lender. But there are other considerations too – how long do you want the loan for? Are there any early repayment charges? Is the loan suitable for your purposes?

    
    With moneySOS, you’ll find the answers to these questions, quickly and easily.
